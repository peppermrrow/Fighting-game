put comments at functions that can't describe their functionality
put comments to explain specific unorthodox choices
put comments when functionality is complex, to summarize
do not use comments to explain the obvious
good comment:
// schedule removal so list doesn't get altered while checked
bad comment:
activeKeys.Add(key); // Add the key when pressed
